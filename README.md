* The purpose of this project is to be an evolving prototype for a future portfolio. *
    - This will be used to market myself, my skills, and my previous work to potential employers.
    - As of now, my "About Me" page and "Portfolio" page are all skeletons in which I'll fill in the gaps, and replace content as the course progresses.
    - For now, the main focus of this was having functional links, image responsiveness, and utilization of Bootstrap tools to create a visually apealling set of webpages.
