* The purpose of this page is to be a prototype for a future portfolio. *
    - As of now, my "About Me" page and "Portfolio" page are all skeletons in which I'll fill in the gaps, and replace content as the course progresses.
    - The "Dog Photos" navbar tag is intentionally disabled. (Placed for novelty, until the page becomes something more serious.)
    - For now, the main focus of this was having functional links, image responsiveness, and utilization of Bootstrap tools to create a visually apealling set of webpages.
